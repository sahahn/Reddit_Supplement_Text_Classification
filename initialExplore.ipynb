[downriggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/downrigger) can also be used to keep the lures or baits trailing at a desired depth.\\n\\n&gt;====\\n\\n&gt;[**image**](https://i.imgur.com/kh6jsxb.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:trolling_for_bluefish2.jpg) - *\"trolling for blue fish\" lithograph by currier &amp; ives, 1866.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n^interesting: [^handline ^fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/handline_fishing) ^| [^fishing ^industry ^in ^palau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishing_industry_in_palau) ^| [^clonk ^\\\\(fishing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clonk_\\\\(fishing\\\\)) \\n\\n^parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^nsfw](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=autowikibot nsfw toggle&amp;message=%2btoggle-nsfw+cnaz10u) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=autowikibot deletion&amp;message=%2bdelete+cnaz10u)^. ^will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(faqs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^magic ^words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)',\n",
